# @vighnesh153/use-global-state

`react-use-global-state` is an extremely lightweight library `< 1KB` that provides a React hook for having a piece of global state. It is similar to the react's `useState` hook but with the only addition that this hook persists the state globally.

This is also an alternative to the popular state management systems like `Redux`, `MobX` or even the built-in `Context API`. We can completely rely on hooks for handling the state for us.
